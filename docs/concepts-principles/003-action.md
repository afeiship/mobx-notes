# action

- An action is any piece of code that changes the state.
- User events, backend data pushes, scheduled events, etc.
- An action is like a user that enters a new value in a spreadsheet cell.

Actions can be defined explicitly in MobX to help you to structure code more clearly.
If MobX is used in strict mode, MobX will enforce that no state can be modified outside actions.
